# BioG1
application for generating biomorphs

An old project for creating biomorphs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickover_stalk)
It has been abandoned and I leave it here for historical reference

With enough time I may restart the project (rewrite it)

The code should produce functional app although it has been so long ago that I'm unable to provide meaningful documentation for it

Application is written in Java language and imports Processing (https://processing.org/) as a library.
